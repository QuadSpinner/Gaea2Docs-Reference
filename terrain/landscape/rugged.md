# Rugged



Rugged is a very powerful LookDev node that creates a strong, rocky surface for any terrain while preserving overall shape. This enables you to add tremendous amounts of details to any surface. This node is also useful for breaking up geometric or linear terrains.

One of the useful features of this node is that the Depth parameter is a relative value. Identations created with the Rugged node use different depths, within the range defined in the Depth parameter. The resulting indentations are more natural, especially with the rock fusion that occurs at the side opposite the main edge of each broken "plate".

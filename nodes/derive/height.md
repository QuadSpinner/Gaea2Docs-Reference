# Height

The **Height** node creates a selection mask based on terrain elevation, isolating areas within the specified height range.

## Properties

* **Range**\
  Sets the minimum and maximum elevation limits for the selection. Only terrain within this range is included in the mask.
* **Falloff**\
  Controls the soft transition at the range boundaries. Higher values create a smoother, more gradual fade between selected and unselected areas.

# Autolevel

AutoLevel is a leveling node that allows you to level your terrain. This node can be useful when you want to stretch your terrain vertically or emphasize certain types of heights. It can also be very useful when working with masks; such as Flow output from the Erosion node, or any other 2D mask that may look too faint.

By default, AutoLevel automatically stretches the heights of the terrain between 0 to 100% height while maintaing the proportions.



This node does not have any properties or controls.

For more convenient usage, try the Autolevel via Modifiers. See [Using Modifiers](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-MRH8eXs83d5sUGKdsHp/using-gaea/managing-graphs/using-modifiers "mention")

Or you can try the [adjust.md](adjust.md "mention") node which is an easier to use node and provides additional functionality.

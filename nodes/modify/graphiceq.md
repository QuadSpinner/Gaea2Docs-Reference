# GraphicEQ

Applies a multi-band equalizer-style filter to shape terrain features across different scales.

* **Band 1–7**\
  Seven adjustable frequency bands. Each band controls the gain for a specific range of detail scales:
  * Lower bands affect large-scale, broad features.
  * Higher bands target fine details.
  * Positive values boost features at that scale; negative values suppress them.

Use the bands together to fine-tune the terrain’s overall frequency profile and achieve precise control over its shape and detail distribution.

Whorl applies multiple vortex-like distortions across the terrain to create large scale warping. This can be very useful when creating massive landscapes and wanting to avoid a patterning in the noise, or for creating slightly surreal or alien landscapes.

{% hint style="info" %} 
Whorl can be overpowering if used by itself. An effective way to tone down Whorl is to lower the Influence value in [Modifier Stack](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-MRH8eXs83d5sUGKdsHp/getting-started/user-interface/property-editor/modifier-stack "mention") or use one of the blend modes.

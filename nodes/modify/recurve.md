Recurve is a curvature-based expander node. It can inflate and/or deflate the terrain to create stronger slopes and larger, softer formations from a given noise or terrain.

{% hint style="info" %} 
Despite appearances, Recurve's output is very sensitive to subtle changes in the source heightfield. For example, if prior to Recurve you apply MicroErosion or Breaker, then Recurve will create a very specific flow pattern on those grooves and valleys.

  The strength of the inflate/deflate operation. Higher values cause drastic shifts in shape formation.
- **Scale**  
  The amount of details to preserve. Higher values cause more prominent shapes to form.

Distance is a simple Distance Transform node that allows you to create a sloping shape from a flat shape. It is similar to the Distance mode in Apex but far superior and efficient. It works very well in conjunction with nodes such as Mask, Island, Abs, and anything else that produces hard, flat shapes.

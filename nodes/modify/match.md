# Match

The Match node is a low-level lets you provide a Reference input that is used to adapt/match the heights of the main Input.

This is useful when you need terrains to be a precise height, but lose some heights after a particular effect, erosion, or other processes.



* Mode
  * **Height:** Uses precise minimum/maximum heights for reference.
  * **Histogram:** Uses a histogram to readjust the terrain.

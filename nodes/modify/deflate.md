# Deflate

Deflate takes away the bulk of the terrain leaving only finer details. The higher the amount, the fewer large details.

This is useful for extracting DetailNormal-friendly shapes, isolating fine/high-frequency shapes for adding on other terrains, and simply reducing the bulk of the terrain.



* **Amount**  
  Deflation amount of the terrain.

# Debris

* **Debris Amount** – Controls how many individual rocks or debris pieces are emitted.
* **Amount Multiplier** – Scales the emitted debris amount globally without changing other parameters.
* **Friction** – Determines how easily debris slides; higher values make debris stop sooner and form steeper piles.
* **Restitution** – Controls energy loss on impact, affecting how far debris bounces or continues sliding.
* **Size** – Sets the overall size of the emitted rocks or debris pieces.
* **Height** – Defines the vertical offset or emission height for debris release.
* **Seed** – Randomization seed for generating varied debris distributions.
* **Shape**
  * **Rounded** – Produces smoother, rounded rock fragments.
  * **Sharp** – Produces jagged, angular rock fragments.
* **Render Still Rocks** – Enables rendering of non-moving debris settled on the terrain.
* **Distribution**
  * **Uniform** – Evenly spreads debris across the emission area.
  * **Natural** – Creates more organic, irregular clustering of debris.

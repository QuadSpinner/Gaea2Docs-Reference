**New Features and Enhancements:**
# Properties

* **Expanded Erosion Options:** The new algorithm introduces additional parameters, allowing for more precise control over terrain erosion.
* **New Terrain Shapes:** Erosion\_2 enables the creation of terrain features that were not possible with the previous algorithm.
* **Terrain Character Preservation:** The new algorithm better preserves the underlying characteristics of the original terrain during the erosion process.
* **Side-by-Side Operation:** Erosion\_2 is fully compatible with Classic Erosion, allowing users to choose between or combine both algorithms for different results.
* **Ease of Use:** The controls for Erosion\_2 have been simplified, making it easier to achieve desired outcomes.
* **Deterministic Results:** Erosion\_2 maintains consistent, deterministic results without any loss in performance.

Erosion\_2 also offers significant performance improvements, with speed boosts of up to 10x compared to Erosion\_1, even when running on the CPU. his new algorithm strikes a balance between generating realistic erosion effects and allowing for artistic flexibility, making it possible to create terrain shapes that were previously challenging or impractical with Classic Erosion.

# Dusting

Dusting is a lightweight snow node which adds a thin layer of snow to your scene with a focus on creating light sprinklings of snow.

This node can be used with or without Snow.

## Properties

* **Coverage**\
  Adjusts the overall amount of snow applied.
* **Flow**\
  Simulates subtle downhill drift and redistribution of snow.
* **Melt**\
  Reduces coverage in sun-exposed areas, mimicking melting patterns.

  Lets Dusting respect and blend with existing snow layers in the scene.

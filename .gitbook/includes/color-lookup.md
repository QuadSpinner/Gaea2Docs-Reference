title: Color lookup
---

Color lookup works by taking a black-and-white mask (where white means "apply fully" and black means "don’t apply") and mapping colors onto it using a predefined color gradient or lookup table (LUT). Essentially, it “paints” the terrain or object by assigning specific colors to different mask values, creating smooth transitions and natural-looking variations automatically. This process makes it easy to add realistic colors, like dry-to-wet soil gradients or layered rock tones, without manually painting every detail.

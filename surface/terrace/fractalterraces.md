# FractalTerraces



FractalTerraces creates terraces or stratification of the terrain. The node is fractal in nature, and terracing is performed in multiple octaves giving you a very high level of detail.

You get detailed control over the edge shape, uniformity, rock hardness, and overall character of the terracing.



# Properties


| Property | Description| 
| -------- | -----------|
| Spacing | The space between two terraces. |
| Octaves | The number of terraces to generate, including subtle sub-terraces based on the space value above. |
| Intensity | The strength of the terracing process. Higher intensities flatten the terrace. |
| Shape | The general shape of the terraces. Lower values create steeper terraces that are closer to the terrain's bulk, while higher create smoother terraces that protrude outward. |
| Seed | The randomization pattern or seed for the node's process. |

# ThermalShaper



ThermalShaper is a fast and effective way of condensing and coalescing shapes similar to what @Shaper does, but in a way where it is in line with what @Thermal Erosion does to a terrain.

You can use it to create smoother ridges, or even bulk up a terrain without creating bulbous shapes. ThermalShaper works very well with @Rivers.



# Properties


| Property | Description| 
| -------- | -----------|
| Influence | The influence of the shaping on the input terrain. Mid-values can give you good balance between the stark shape and the original terrain. |
| Shape | Negative values will condense the terrain into concise, sharp ridges, while positive values will bulk up the terrain by adding bulge. |
